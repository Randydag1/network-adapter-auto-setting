To manage the rules and data more effectively, you can use a separate JSON file linked to the same code. This approach allows for easy updates and modifications without altering the main script.

Steps to link a separate JSON file to the code:

1. Create a JSON File: This file will contain your rules and other configurations (e.g., rules for data evaluation, dataset file paths).

Example:

{
    "rules": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        // Add more rules as needed
    },
    "data_file": "path_to_data_file.json"
}


2. Modify the main function to accept the path to this configuration file and read it:

import json

# Function to load data from a file
def load_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    return data

# Function to evaluate data against a set of rules
def evaluate_data(data, rules):
    results = {}
    for key, value in rules.items():
        results[key] = []
        for entry in data:
            if entry[key] == value:  # Simple equality check for demonstration
                results[key].append(entry)
    return results

# Function to create chain codes based on evaluation results
def create_chain_codes(results):
    chain_codes = {}
    for key, value in results.items():
        chain_codes[key] = len(value)  # Count the number of matching entries as chain code
    return chain_codes

# Main function to tie everything together
def main(config_file):
    # Load configuration
    with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
        config = json.load(file)

    # Load data and rules
    data = load_data(config['data_file'])
    rules = config['rules']

    # Evaluate data
    results = evaluate_data(data, rules)

    # Create chain codes
    chain_codes = create_chain_codes(results)

    # Output the chain codes
    print("Chain Codes:", chain_codes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define path to your configuration file
    CONFIG_FILE = 'path_to_config_file.json'

    main(CONFIG_FILE)


3. Place the configuration file (path_to_config_file.json) alongside your script or provide the correct path to it.



By linking the configuration file, you separate concerns and make it easier to update the rules or datasets without modifying the core script. This approach also enhances flexibility, as rules and datasets can be adjusted without recompiling or re-deploying the main program.

Would you like to proceed with the creation of the configuration file or need further assistance with the code implementation?
